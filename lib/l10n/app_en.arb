    "faqTitle1": "F.I.T",
    "faqQ1": "What is F.I.T.?",
    "faqA1": "The Fecal Immunochemical Test (F.I.T.) is a stool test that detects blood in the stool not seen with the naked eye. It is done at home and taken to the laboratory for analysis.",
    "faqQ2": "How can I get the F.I.T.?",
    "faqA2": "Your family physician, gastroenterologist can give you the laboratory requisition and you can also do it without the doctor’s requisition,  You can buy the container from the pharmacy to collect the sample of stool, and then take it to the laboratory  to be processed. You can call SAID NGO for assistance; laboratories processing the F.I.T., cost and relevant information.",
    "faqQ3": "When do I get the F.I.T. results?",
    "faqA3": "It takes 1 to 2 days for the results.",
    "faqQ4": "What can the FIT results be?",
    "faqA4": "A negative F.I.T. test means that there is no blood in the stool. The doctor will ask you to repeat the test annually.\n\nA positive F.I.T. test means that there is blood in the stool. This is not necessarily cancer but you will have to do a colonoscopy to find out why you have blood in your stool.",
    "faqQ5": "How accurate is the F.I.T. result?",
    "faqA5": "No test is 100% accurate. There is a chance that a pre-cancerous polyp or cancer can be missed if it wasn’t bleeding when the test was done, thus the importance of REPEATING it annually  Regular screening gives you the best chance of colorectal cancer being found early, when treatment may be more successful.",
    "faqTitle2": "Colonoscopy",
    "faqQ6": "What is a colonoscopy?",
    "faqA6": "A colonoscopy is aprocedure done by a gastroenterologist in a hospital or specialized clinic to examine the lining of your colon (large intestine) to find and remove polyps before they become colon cancers.\nIt is a flexible tube inserted into the rectum and goes up to the colon to look for signs of cancer or pre-cancerous lesions. During colonoscopy, polyps (precancerous and cancerous) are removed and biopsied.",
    "faqQ7": "What do I need to do to prepare for a colonoscopy?",
    "faqA7": "A few days before the colonoscopy — Start eating a low-fiber diet: no whole grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, or raw fruits or vegetables. Ask your doctor if you need to stop any medications.\n\nThe day before the colonoscopy procedure — don’t eat solid foods. Instead, consume only clear liquids like clear broth or bouillon, black coffee or tea, clear juice (apple, white grape), clear soft drinks or sports drinks, Jell-O (not red though), popsicles, etc.\n\nThe day of the colonoscopy procedure — As on the previous day, clear liquid foods only. Don't eat or drink anything two hours before the procedure.\n\n\n            Before the procedure, usually 12-24 hours, you need to clean your bowel with a special preparatory solution recommended by your physician. It is important that you follow the instructions properly. Not adequately cleaned bowel can increases the risk of missing on polyps or repeating the test.",
    "faqQ8": "How is a colonoscopy done?",
    "faqA8": "When you are in the endoscopy unit,, you will receive a sedation (not general anesthesia) meaning that you will not feel any discomfort during the procedure.\nThe procedure itself may take between 15 and 60 minutes.\nAfter the procedure, you need to wait for about 30 minutes to recover.\nBecause of the sedation,  you are not allowed to drive home.",
    "faqQ9": "Is my colonoscopy covered by an insurance?",
    "faqA9": "Insurance coverage varies. You should check with your health insurance provider to determine the coverage. If you have a “Daman” (National Social Security Fund), you need to pay for the colonoscopy out-of-pocket and reimbursed after (provided it is done as in-patient).",
    "faqQ10": "What is the average cost of a colonoscopy?",
    "faqA10": "A colonoscopy in Lebanon can cost between 1,500,000 L.L. and 4,000,000 depending on the hospital",
    "faqQ11": "Are colonoscopy services available in all regions of Lebanon?",
    "faqA11": "Yes, all regions of Lebanon have colonoscopy services. To find the closest location, ask your provider or contact SAID NGO for assistance and advice about quality controlled ones.",
    "faqQ12": "If I am menstruating can I have a colonoscopy?",
    "faqA12": "Yes. There is no contraindication.",
    "faqQ13": "If I have fever can I have a colonoscopy?",
    "faqA13": "No, it is not recommended. Check with your provider.",
    "faqQ14": "If I am taking medications, can I have a colonoscopy?",
    "faqA14": "Most medications do not interfere with the colonoscopy. Consult with your physician if you are taking insulin to adjust the dose if necessary.\nIf you are on anti-coagulant, you need to stop them before the procedure to avoid bleeding in the situation where polyps removal are necessitated. A diagnostic colonoscopy isn't likely to cause bleeding. But if the doctor has to remove any polyps from the colon, the risk of bleeding rises.\nCheck with your physician about adjusting the anti-coagulant.",
    "faqQ15": "Do I need time off to do a colonoscopy?",
    "faqA15": "Yes, you need to take off the day you are doing the procedure.When done early in the morning, you can go back to work 3 to 4 hours after done.\nFor the preparation, you also need to be at home.",
    "faqQ16": "Are there side effects or complications after the colonoscopy?",
    "faqA16": "Generally No.\n\nWhile all procedures have some risk, colonoscopies are done every day and are considered safe. In fact, your chances of getting colon or colorectal cancer far outweigh the possibility of complications from a colonoscopy.\n\nOn the other hand, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy says that there are less than 3 serious complications for every 1,000 procedures done in people of average risk for colorectal cancer.\n\n Very few cases of intestinal perforations can happen in the rectum wall or colon. They can be made accidentally during the procedure by an instrument. These punctures are slightly more likely to occur if a polyp is removed. However, perforations can often be treated with watchful waiting, bed rest, and antibiotics. Large tears, however, are medical emergencies that require surgical repair.\n\nBleeding  at the site of a polyp removal. Bleeding usually does not require any intervention.\nIf a tissue sample is taken or a polyp removed, you may notice some bleeding from your rectum, or blood in your stool a day or two after the test.\nMost cases of bleeding stop without treatment or can be controlled at the time of the procedure.\nThis is typically nothing to be worried about. However, if the bleeding is heavy, or doesn’t stop, let your doctor know.\nIn case you have severe abdominal pain, dizziness, fever, chills or rectal bleeding after the colonoscopy check with your provider.",
